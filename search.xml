    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Problems about survey/statistics/studySelective sample摘引原文存疑部分The arguer’s recommendation depends on/relies on/rests on/bases on the assumption that the survey’s results are reliable. Initially/primarily/to begin with, the author assumes… 指出问题This might not be the case.This is not necessarily the case.This is not always the case.… because/in that suffer from statistical problemthe methodology might be problematic 分析逻辑漏洞（选择性样本）The arguer does not/fails to provide any evidence to prove that…We are not informed whether…Information is not given concerning/regarding/with regard to/in regard to Be representative of…Constitute a representative sample of…Be typical of/typify/stand for/represent/characterize… 更多句式表达The result of the survey lacks credibility because … were actually excluded from the survey. The author considers only… Although … do constitute a significant part of …, however, … are actually excluded from the survey. These statistics were based only on data from…; however, it is entirely possible that … are not representative overall. The author overlooks the possibility that … The author also ignores the possibility that …. …differ conspicuously 段落总结Without ruling out these possible scenarios, the author cannot resonably rely on these statistics to support the claim. In short, without sufficient evidence to substantiate the assumption/the survey is trustworthy, the arguer’s recommendation is unconvincing. Do the statistics make any difference?Weak point:The author treats a lack of proof that something is the case as constituting sufficient proof that it is not the case. (Does the survey make any difference?) One possible body paragraph:The argument treates a lack of proof thatas constituting sufficient proof thatthe arguer overlooks the possibility thatWithout ruling out this scenario, the arguer cannot justify the conclusion Quantity of the smaple质疑方法：指出样本数量过少（可与样本的其他漏洞并为一段）因果关系 指出样本数量过少：The result of the survey lacks credibility because the smaple is too limited/insufficient/inadequate. The mere sample of … is too limited to constitute convincing evidence. 分析因果错误(例举他因他果） 归因于 后加原因Can be attributed to/ascribed to/be attributable to/result from后加结果Lead to/result in/cause/contribute to/trigger/bring aboutanyone of a myriad of (numerious) other factors, such as … might explain What question was asked in the survey? (调查问题不相关）质疑方法： 指出问题不相关（可与样本的其他问题并为一段）the question asked in the servey … has little to do with/has not much bearing on/ is not a determinant factor in whether or not… Are the respondents forthright?质疑方法： 列举回应者说谎的可能性（符合常理，能够推翻结论） We are not informed whether the survey responses are anonymous, even confidential. If they were not, … Problems about data/informationVague data 模糊数据绝对总量和相对比例的混淆只知总量，不知比例质疑方法： 指出比例可能很大或很小（符合常理，能够推翻结论） 只知比例，不知基数质疑方法： 指出基数可能很大或很小 Incomplete information质疑方法： 列举作者未提供的信息 #Flaws in the reasoning line 比较类（错误类比，横向纵向对比，不全面对比，时间推测） 因果类（先因后果，同时因果，强加因果，非此即彼） 范围类（以偏概全，以全概偏） 比较类指出问题The author commits the fallacy of “all things are equal”.The author’s conclusion bases on false analogy.The argument rests on the assumption that A is analogous to/similar/identical to B in all respects. 分析问题（指出不同）This assumption is weak, since althoughthere are points of comparison between A and B, there are many dissimilarties/differences as well. For example, A…; however, B… . 段落总结In short, without accounting for important possible differences between A and B, the arguer cannot resonably/plausibly prove the proposed method 根据具体题目确定will help A. 错误类比 (False analogy)句式积累指出问题The arguer simply assumes that…, but he does not provide any evidence that A and B are indeed comparable.分析问题As we know, …differ conspicuously. It is true that both … and …, but there exist fundamental differences: …段落总结Therefore, even though … proved effective in A, there is no guarantee that it will work just as well for B. 横向比较纵向比较混淆（confusing comparison and variation)质疑方法：列举使用另一种比较的可能结果。 不完整比较（Incomplete comparison)质疑方法：列举作者未比较的方面句式表达积累：指出问题：The author hastily implies that … is superior to … in …, but the comparison between … and … is incomplete.分析问题：The author only compares …; however, there are a myriad of factors which, if differ in these cases, would bring about totally different result for the comparison. For example, … .段末总结：Without any further consideration about these factors, the author could not convince us that … is better than … in merely based on an incomplete comparison. 时间推测过去推现在，过去推将来，现在推将来，现在推过去（极少）质疑方法：列举这段时间内的变化因素句式表达积累：现在推将来摘引原文存疑部分The author claims that 将来, because 现在/过去指出问题：This assumption is unwarranted because things rarely/seldom/barely remain the same/unchanged/constant/unaltered over extended period of time.分析问题：There are likely all kinds of differences between 过去 and 将来. For example, 现在; however, 过去.段落总结：Any of these scenarios, if true, would serve to undermine the claim that … . 现在推将来句式积累:The auguer unfairly assumes that there will be no significant change in … in the future.The author assumes without justification that the trends of … will continue in the future. 过去推现在指出问题：The arguer’s inference is that … which worked so well to … in the past will surely be of equal benefit in the future rests on the poor assumption that during … all the conditions upon which … depends have remained unchanged.分析问题：The arguer overlooks the possibility that … would …, or that … would … .段落总结：Without taking into account these possibilities, the arguer’s recommendation that … is flimsy. 因果类 时间与因果关系Post hoc, ergo proper hoc(after this, therefore because of this) 时序先后因果关系错误提出问题：Based on the fact that … occur after…, the argument infers that … should be responsible for/result in/contribute to/trigger/bring about/lead to … .分析问题（列举他因）：However, the sequence of these events, in itself, does not guarantee that the former caused the latter one. It might have resulted from/attributed to/ascribed to some other factors instead. To just list/name a few possibilities… 列举他因.段落总结：Without ruling out scenarios such as these, the arguer cannot establish a cause-and-effect/casual relationshop between…an… upon which the recommendation depends. 提出问题：The author assumes that A caused B.分析问题：The line of the reasoning is that because A before B, the former event caused the latter. But this is fallacious reasoning unless other possible causal explanations have been considered and ruled out. For example, perhaps A1 is the cause of these events or perhaps B is caused by A2.段落总结：Without ruling out scenarios such as these, the arguer cannot establish a cause-and-effect/casual relationship between … and… upon which the recommendation depends. 同时因果错误 （Concurrence) 提出问题：Merely a concurrence of … and … does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between them.Merely a coincidence of two evnets could not sufficiently demonstrate a causal relationshop between them.The arguer may confuse concurrence with causality. 段落总结：Without ruling out such factors, we could not be convinced that is the actual cause of and consequently the final conclusion based on the causal relationship is unjustified. (7.22 continue) 无因果关系（强加因果） 例句同上 非此即彼类谬误 （false dilemma / either-or fallacy) 指出问题：The author’s recommendation/conclusion rests on the unlikely/unconvincing/unpersuasive ssumption that … has only two alternatives/results that …分析问题：In all likelihood, … can engage one of many other … instead.段落总结：Thus, to some extent the author recommends that … either … or … is unwarranted. 范围类范围类推理错误 changing scopes质疑方法： 列举不同范围的差异 以偏概全指出问题：The argument resets on the assumption that 个体案例 typify 整体情况. 分析问题：If this is not the case, then it is entirely possible that 在另一个地方，上述个案的结果不会发生相同的情况。 段落总结：Thus, lacking more information about… nationwide, it is difficult to assess/evaluate the merit of the recommendation. 以全概偏指出问题：One problem with the argument is that is assumes that the nationwide(characterictics/traits/features of a group apply to/be applicable to/be true of every member of that group)statistics about … applies equally to 局部的/个体成员 分析问题（列举他因）Yet this might not be the case, for a variety/myriad of/numerous possible reasons. Perhaps, __; or perhaps …. . 段落总结Without ruling out such possibilities, the author cannot justifiably conclude that…. flaws in conclusion未考虑结果的充分必要性质疑方法：必要性： 没他也行，列举其他充分条件充分性： 光他不够，列举其他必要条件 必要性：The author ignores other solutions/means/approaches/effective ways to …The author fails to substantiate the necessity of …Other solutions could also be used to achieve the author’s purpose.Other possible measures could also be applied/taked to achieve the same 充分性：The author unfairly assumes that … would suffice to/sufficiently guarantee …… alone may not sufficiently ensure…Merely … might not suffice to …… will be influenced/determined/affected by many factors; thus … alone may not ensure … sufficiently. 未考虑结论的可能性质疑方法： 列举实施结论中可能遇到的障碍 指出问题：The feasibility of … is open to doubt.The author fails to consider the feasibility of … . 分析问题：The proposal might not be desirable due to some critical obstacles. For example, some … may not be willing to …, or capable of …, or could afford… .The proposed action may be opposed by …, or may not be effectively executed by … 段落总结：In short, without assessing the feasibility, the arguer’s conclusion remains dubious at best.Unless the author could demonstrate that those obstacles could be effectively overcome, the proposal might be practically unfeasible. 未进行利弊权衡质疑方法： 列举实施结论中忽略的利或弊 指出问题：The author fails to thoroughly evaluate the positive and negative effects of …The author needs to do more comprehensive research on both positive and negative effects of … 分析问题：Although the proposal could be adopted to … to a certain degree; however, carrying out the proposal may actually bring about more harmful/rewarding effects. For example, … 段落总结：Under such scenario, adopting the author’s proposal would harm/benefit rather than benefit/harm … 利润类 （profit = revenue - cost) 指出问题：The author fails to thoroughly evaluate the positive and negative effects of …The author assumes without warrant that the benefits of … will outweigh its costs. 分析问题：Profit is a factor of / influenced by not only revenue but also costs/ costs as well as revenue. It is entirely possible /there is the likelihood that the costs of …, such as…, will offset or even outweigh additional revenue, if there is any. 段落总结：In short, disadvantages may outweigh advantanges. If so, then the arguer’s recommendation of … would seem ill-advised.]]></content>
